                  <h4>Health Care</h4>
                  <p align="justify">The proportion of aging population who need more personalized care 
                      and round-the-clock treatment is increasing, propelling the need for more human resources 
                      in hospitals. Healthcare, along with technology, will give the industry and care providers 
                      the ability to simplify processes and offer personalized care with greater efficiency. Using 
                      technology driven solutions to replace labor-intensive tasks that are better done by machines 
                      can be a big time-saver.</p>

                          as augmented reality (remember Pokémon Go), speech recognition, indoor navigation, and even learning 
                          the daily tasks and preferences of an individual to enable digital assistants like Siri and Alexa.Customer service chatbots, 
                          like CenturyLink’s ‘sales assistant’, speech and voice services for customers where they can explore or buy content by speaking, 
                          traffic classification, network optimization and orchestration, and predictive network maintenance, like AT&T’s self-healing and 
                          self-learning hardware that’s powered by artificial intelligence are among some AI applications that are used by the leading players 
                          and are among the emerging trends in the telecommunication sector.</p>

  <h4>Retail</h4>
  <p align="justify"> Market knowledge, as well as control of data and information, is key to obtaining a competitive advantage in the retail sector. 
                  Markets are continuing to grow and become more complex; the simple process of retailing has started to deploy more advanced retail 
                  information systems to cope with all the transactions involved.
                  Today, retailers need to transform their IT capabilities for multiple reasons, including:
To increase the company’s ability to respond to the evolving marketplace through enhanced speed and flexibility.
To collect and analyze customer data while enhancing differentiation.

  <h4>Insurance</h4>
  <p align="justify"> Technology will once again be the differentiator for insurers who embrace technology 
              to enhance customer experience while selling a commoditised insurance product.
   Technology can also be further used to penetrate emerging markets. For instance, 
   with the increasing penetration of mobile users in developing countries, a telecommunications
    company acting as an agent to sell insurance products will soon become reality. 
    New partnerships will be formed.
